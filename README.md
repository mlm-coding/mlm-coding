 <summary><h3> âŒ¨ Marc's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   My coding journey began during my senior year of high school when I was uncertain about my college and career path. None of the options I explored seemed to align with my aspirations. Then, one day, I stumbled upon a website that demystified programming and introduced me to the exciting world of coding-related careers. This discovery ignited a passion within me, and I devoted a significant portion of my free time to self-learning Python and absorbing as much coding knowledge as possible.

As I embarked on my college journey, I officially declared myself a computer science student, and ever since, my enthusiasm for coding has been unwavering. While coding, as well as the related coursework, can be challenging at times, the sense of fulfillment it brings is immeasurable. I eagerly anticipate the continuation of my journey, where I aim to enhance my skills and delve into new areas of knowledge within the field of programming.
